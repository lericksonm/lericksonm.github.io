                        <p>As a preliminary approach to introducing design thinking principles to small restuarant operations, I altered these 4 design thinking tools to adhere with a restaurant vernacular.

                        <h3>Conclussion</h3>
                        <p>During the process of the service design research project, I quickly realized how complicated restuarant process are. Running a small restaurant that is sustainably profitable is extremely hard. An interesting determinant I uncovered for success is the restaurant owner's ability to seek out advice and listen to others. My research in this area will continue. In my local town, a fully volunteer run morning cafe has greatly impacted the towns people's daily lives. As described by Ray Odenburg in <i>The Great Good Place</i> 3rd spaces are needed in small town america and through introducing willing operators to basic design principles could lead them to a higher chance for success.</p>
